// the current date is at the top of the page when the user loads it

// present all events to the user of the page that are within business hours

// give the user the ability to add and delete events from the schedule

// events are color coded depending on if the event has happened, is going to, or is already happening

// events are saved in the local storage so when the user returns, the data remains on the page and persists through a refresh of the page
