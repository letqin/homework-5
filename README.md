# CalenDIR

This is a calendar application for the work place. Not only will this calendar track the time and details of today's events, but the time and the date! The time blocks will display the business hours when you scroll down. Events can be saved and will be accessible after refresh.

## How to Use CalenDIR

Download the application from this repository (there is a link at the end of this README) and run locally. This application makes use of the local storage of your web browser so it can be used offline when installed locally.

## What was the Motivation

Being a person who has grown up in a household with a family business, I believe any technology that makes anyone's job easier should be considered. This application allows you to plan out your work days with events and keep track of when they are upcoming, ongoing, or have concluded. This allows you to remember (and possibly forget) less business related tasks.
